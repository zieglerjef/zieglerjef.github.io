<details><summary> Abstract </summary>
<p>
<br/>
One of the more important innovations in the study of how citizens assess the U.S. Supreme Court is the ideological updating model, which assumes that citizens grant legitimacy to the institution according to the perceived distance between themselves and the Court on a unidimensional ideological (liberal–conservative) continuum. Under this model, citizens are also said to update this calculation with every new salient Supreme Court decision. The model’s requirements, however, do not seem to square with the long-established view that Americans are largely innocent of ideology. Here, we conduct an audit of the model’s mechanisms using a series of empirical tests applied to a nationally representative sample. Our general conclusion is that the ideological updating model, especially when supplemented with the requirement that citizens must become aware of Court decisions, simply does not square with the realities of American politics. Students of Supreme Court legitimacy may therefore want to search for other theories of legitimacy updating.

**Ziegler, Jeffrey**. ”A Text-As-Data Approach for Using Open-Ended Responses as Manipulation Checks".

<details><summary> Abstract </summary>
<br/><p>
Social scientists more frequently take advantage of online work forces to test theoretical claims, yet remote respondents are often inattentive, which can hinder researchers’ ability to draw substantive or causal inferences. Though researchers are aware of this potential estimation bias, there are few proposed solutions beyond the inclusion of multiple factual or informational questions. Researchers then often remove inattentive respondents from the sample based on their inability to answer manipulation checks, potentially causing researcher induced post-treatment bias. In response to these shortcomings, I develop a cost-effective and standardized methodology that relies on the text provided by respondents from open-ended manipulation checks as data. This approach reduces the need for subjective, paid humans to analyze open-ended text and does not require researchers to drop participants that would fail a traditional manipulation check. I additionally develop a package in <tt>R</tt> to help practitioners diagnose inattentive online workers as well as estimate the impact of their inattention on the outcome question(s).

**Ziegler, Jeffrey**. ”Responsiveness and Unelected Leaders: Lessons from the Catholic Church".

<details><summary> Abstract </summary>
<br/><p>
Are leaders responsive to their members' preferences over time, even when formal accountability mechanisms such as elections are weak or absent? Unelected leaders, especially religious leaders, typically influence their supporters' preferences, yet I suggest they should also have strong incentives to be responsive because they rely on dedicated, core members for legitimacy, volunteerism, and financial support. I test this argument by first analyzing over 10,000 papal messages to confirm the papacy is responsive to Catholic public opinion. I then conduct survey experiments using nationally representative samples of Catholics in Brazil and Mexico to show that members increase their organizational trust and participation as a function of their existing organizational commitment, and the anticipated cost of support. The evidence suggests that leaders have incentives to be responsive besides elections, although there may be limits to the benefits that members provide in return.

**Ziegler, Jeffrey**. ”The Expansion of the Catholic Church: Serving Members, Eliminating Competition, or Lobbying Allies?”.

<details><summary> Abstract </summary>
<br/><p>
Religious organizations that pursue a political agenda must coordinate the demands of existing members, and compete against rival religious groups for supporters and political influence. There is not, however, a precise explanation for how and when religious organizations globally expand given these competing objectives. I theorize that religious organizations, as interest or non-governmental organizations, do protect against competing denominations and service current followers, but they primarily expand their organizational capacity to target legislators when a government is a political ally. I test this prediction using original data of over 2,300 changes within the Catholic Church’s diocese hierarchy from 1900 to 2010. The results show that the Church is more likely to invest resources in a country when the government is a political ally. Importantly, the Church does not divert existing resources from members, or when there are greater numbers of Pentecostal and Evangelical supporters. The findings help illustrate the constraints and priorities that religious groups face in expanding their international political reach.

**Ziegler, Jeffrey** & David Carlson. ”The Role of Credible Elections and Indirect Expropriation in Explaining International Investment Treaty Violations”.

<details><summary> Abstract </summary>
<br/><p>
Democracies are thought to violate treaties less frequently than non-democracies, yet democracies violate bilateral investment treaties (BITs) more often. Though democratic governments may intend to meet their international obligations, and though democratic institutions provide greater political constraints to encourage compliance, investment agreements may conflict with the goal of maintaining domestic public support. Specifically, we argue that credible elections create strong incentives for governments to side with domestic voters over foreign business interests, and to pass legislation that violates investment agreements. We use a data set of BIT violation complaints that better captures potential indirect expropriation to confirm prior findings that show a difference in violations by regime type. Importantly, however, governments are only more likely to violate BITs as credible elections approach. The results suggest that the ability of voters to sanction leaders is an important mechanism that incentivizes governments to potentially violate investment treaties through indirect expropriation.

Bechtel, Michael M. & **Jeffrey Ziegler**. ”Foreign Policy Interests and International Disaster Assistance”.

<details><summary> Abstract </summary>
<br/><p>
How does international financial assistance reflect strategic political interests? The "buying influence" argument predicts that countries provide more support to governments that pursue antithetical foreign policy objectives to induce favorable policy shifts. However, such efforts seem unlikely to persuade highly antithetical governments to engage in drastic policy changes and may not be necessary if a
recipient country already pursues compatible foreign policies. We analyze international responses to natural disasters using data for 203 countries from 2000 to 2014 and find that donors provide more relief to countries whose foreign policies are moderately aligned. We also explore donors' delivery tactics and find that the probability of providing disaster assistance directly to the recipient country's government is more likely as political affinity with the donor country increases. Overall, the relationships between foreign policy interests and international assistance seem more consistent with a political efficiency logic than with the standard buying influence argument.

Gabel, Matthew & **Jeffrey Ziegler**. ”Automating the CompLaw Database: Exploring the Limits and Possibilities of Replacing Human Coders”.

<details><summary> Abstract </summary>
<br/><p>
The CompLaw database provides a common coding template for describing the context and outcomes of constitutional review across courts and time. In a pilot project, Carrubba et al. (2015) show the template is reasonably successful for systematically coding the relevant information of constitutional rulings for 48 courts for one year (2003). However, the coding template relies on human coding, which severely limits its expansion. In this paper, we evaluate the potential for populating the CompLaw database through an automated process based on the publications of the courts. Automation faces a variety of hurdles related to the formatting of documents and the language used. As a test case, we examine the French Constitutional Council which has rulings and supporting documents available electronically for a long time-series and with some potentially challenging features related to variation in the format/type of rulings (e.g., <i>ex ante</i> vs. <i>ex post</i> review). The goal of the exercise is to learn how much of the coding can be accomplished through automation. And, where automation cannot directly identify the correct information needed to complete the database, we define an algorithm that can isolate the relevant text that a human coder would need to complete the coding.
