Currently Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I study comparative politics, international relations, political economy, as well as religion and politics. In my research, I'm broadly interested in how political organizations or actors, many of whom often fall outside the purview of the general public, impact politics.<br/><br/>

Specifically, my dissertation relates to the legitimacy, responsiveness, and political efforts of religious organizations as international interest or advocacy groups by focusing on the Catholic Church. <br/><br/>

This site includes my research, teaching, and other resources (mainly R examples).<br/><br/>
